Hello, Frivi here again. This time i am gonna show you the best roblox bugg solver that i made.

WARNINGS:
> Save everything named "roblox" that you want (it deletes every "roblox" file name)
> Do not open it if you want your roblox prints saved (or save it by your self)
> It will reboot your machine to aply changes
> Follow the batch tutorial
> It is an false positive tool, not a trojan (this time not one, lol)
> JUST DOWNLOAD ROBLOX once that the file already rebooted your machine/aplied changes
> Don't be scared, i made it silly in late 2022 (to fix exploiting problem)
> If your roblox still bugs to open, try unistall everything that changes your roblox, and even roblox itself and wait one minute and download roblox again.
> This is an quite old tool, if you still face problems and the tip didn't helped, just wait some time and try again, if it still bugs... well, idk :O)

-> Stay clowny :3
